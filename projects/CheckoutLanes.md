summary: A checkout lanes simulator program using a circular array queue for ICS 211.
---

This project was for my ICS 211 class, using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/). For this project, we were expected to implement a circular array queue to simulate grocery store checkout lanes.

There were two types of lanes: express and regular checkout lanes. In the regular checkout lanes, shoppers did not have a minimum or maximum number of items needed. On the other hand, the express lanes gave shoppers a limit of 10 items. If shoppers entered these lanes with more than 10 items, they would be moved to a regular lane. The simulation was finished when all shoppers were successfully checked out.

Here is a sample output of the test cases that I made:
