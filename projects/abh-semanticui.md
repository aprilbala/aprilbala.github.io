summary: Took a non-semantic UI website and designed it using Semantic UI elements.
---
In my software engineering class we were introduced to the beauty of [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/). 

As a mini project, we were expected to take a non-Semantic UI website, and remake a page from it using Semantic UI elements. The main focus of this project was to replicate our chosen website visually, not functionally. 

I chose to remake [Anastasia Beverly Hills](http://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/)' (ABH for short) home page. As part of my remake, I chose to implement the site's header and navigation bar, footer, and banner ads. Additionally, I used Semantic UI's [card](https://semantic-ui.com/views/card.html) element to mimic way the brand presented their most recent product releases. 

At the time of this project, the ABH home page looked like this:
<center>
<div class="ui images"><img src="../images/screenshots-abh-semanticui/abh-1.png" width="600px"></div>
<div class="ui images"><img src="../images/screenshots-abh-semanticui/abh-2.png" width="600px"></div>
</center>

With Semantic UI, I was able to recreate it into this:
<center>
<div class="ui images"><img src="../images/screenshots-abh-semanticui/abh-mock1.png" width="600px"></div>
<div class="ui images"><img src="../images/screenshots-abh-semanticui/abh-mock2.png" width="600px"></div>
</center>
