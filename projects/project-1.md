This is an an assignment that was done for my ICS 111 class, using [jGRASP](http://www.jgrasp.org/). We used Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements to illustrate our Applets.

For this assignment, we specifically needed to follow the criteria below:
  * Colors
    * Use of pre-set colors and custom colors (using RGB values)
  * Shapes & Lines
    * Ovals, rectangles, arcs to make shapes
    * Fill shapes with color, too.
  * Fonts
    * Two different fonts
    * Add color to your fonts
    * Use of style -- i.e. **bold**, *italics*

In addition, we were required to "animate" some part of our applet shapes with the use of a loop. 

Here is a sample of what my applet looked like in action:
