*Cracks of a Broken Heart* (COABH) is a website I created and managed for my high school senior project, *Coping Methods for Teenages and the End of Relationships*. This was a long-term project that started at the end of my junior year. I was fortunate enough to work with a faculty and community advisor for guidance and collaboration for this project. It consisted of a research paper, product, and presentation. What I am sharing with you, is my product. 

COABH was a website that provided viewers [information](http://cracksofabrokenheart.wixsite.com/coabh/research) regarding heartbreaks and coping methods, which I gained knowledge of through my research paper. In addition, COABH was an interactive website that allowed users to [read](http://cracksofabrokenheart.wixsite.com/coabh/stories) and anonymously [submit](http://cracksofabrokenheart.wixsite.com/coabh/submit) their own heartbreak stories to share. I managed these submissions through a seperate email, that I used solely for this project.

The website was designed and made using [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), a free website builder that made it simple to create with the use of templates and drag and drop tools. This project sparked my interest in web design. I enjoyed putting this website together, and I felt a sense of accomplishment seeing how many individuals took part in contributing their stories. I am glad these viewers felt that COABH was a safe place for them to share their feelings with the world. These contributions are what made my project so successful.
