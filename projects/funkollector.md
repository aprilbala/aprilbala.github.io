Funkollector is an assignment that was done for my ICS 321 class, Database Systems I. The purpose of this assignment was to create a database management system (DBMS) web application. I chose to use this assignment as a way to keep track of my collection of Funko Pops. Funko Pops are collectible vinyl figurines made by the [Funko](https://www.funko.com/) company. Over the years, I have accumulated over 20+ figurines. Till this day, my collection continues to grow even more, since the company does really new figurines every few months. 

The plan intended for this web app was to keep track of the figurines I currently owned ("My Collection") and figurines I wanted to add to my collection ("My Wishlist").

Looking back on this project, there are definelty things I would improve and add. For instance, I would add a feature that t=a

At the time this project was done (Spring 2018), the Funko company did not have an app for collectors to use where they could keep track of their collection of figurines. There were third-party made websites, but none were officially affiliated with the Funko company. It was not until 2019 that the Funko company made an [app](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/03/13/1752658/0/en/Funko-Unveils-New-Mobile-Application-with-Fan-Favorite-Capabilities.html) that allowed consumers do so. 

The code for this project can be found in my Funkollector repository on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/aprilbala/funkollector). Additionally, a video explaining the project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqvs8DM7cUA).
